#### ![](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-WIFI-BLE-RFID-NFC-Desk-Contacless-Reader-Writer/blob/main/designs/working_yellow.png) Status: Tested. Require improvements. 

**Known faults:**
- PCB copper track optimizations
- components rearrangement for optimization of PCB track inductance

## Dataverse API C library

This device uses my C++ library to expedite dataverse API integration on smart DAQ devices or elsewhere. Follow the link to its repository:

The photo above is one of the many specimens I purposely fabricated to research self-sensing properties of asphalt mixed with a known content of carbon fibers. This is a 10cm cylinder specimen and on the top is already setup my own design smart #DAQ (get it here on my GitHub ) with the ability to upload LIVE experimental data to a #dataverse.

In the photo above the smart DAQ is installed on an acrylic case and screwed with plastic screws to an acrylic base with the same cross-section area as the specimen to be tested. 
The acrylic base can be bought [here](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DEGsZaL). And the acrylic case [here](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dmudkjt).

## CE Ready Logo
This hardware is ready to get a CE marking. To learn more about this marking goto to [Wikipedia here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE_marking).

### Smart PCB Hardware Specifications
The hardware specifications for the 12bit pcb with dimensions of 23.5x43.5mm can be found [here](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/openScience-Smart-DAQ-to-Upload-Live-Experimental-Data-to-a-Data-Repository/wiki/Smart-DAQ-Specifications).


 **In real life this smart DAQ is able to:**
- connect to all kinds of 3V to 5V Digital sensors;
- connect to all kinds of sensors compatible with the I2C protocol. (max 118 sensors simultaneously)
- measure voltage in the range of  [0;3.3V]
- measure electrical resistance [0; 10^6] Ohm 
- do temperature and humidity compensation on all measurements 
- has a voltage reference sensor for improved accuracy on ADC measurements  
- has a motion sensor to know if anyone moved a specimen during an experiment
- ability to show live experimental data on the 1.69-inch TFT IPS LCD

## Proof of Concept

To test and validate proposed smart DAQ PCB electronics and its firmware as a solution for LIVE experimental data measurements on any test specimen part of a experimental campaign, This PCB electronics is being used to measure a predefined set of variables/parameters to further study several asphalt mixtures with known carbon fiber weight content in the asphalt matrix. Below is a YouTube link to an unedited short video showing one of the experimental setups.
